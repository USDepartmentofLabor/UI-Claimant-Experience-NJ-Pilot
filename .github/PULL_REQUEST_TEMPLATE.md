[How we work](https://github.com/newjersey/dol-ui-claimant-intake/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### As the original developer, I have

#### Satisfied acceptance criteria and met development standards

- [ ] Met the acceptance criteria, or will meet them in a subsequent PR
- [ ] Created/modified automated tests
- [ ] For any fields that have been edited in or removed from the claim form, corresponding edits have been made in the [json schema](https://github.com/newjersey/dol-ui-claimant-intake/blob/main/schemas/claim-v1.0.json) _and_ synced to the ["all-fields" schema](https://github.com/newjersey/dol-ui-claimant-intake/blob/main/schemas/claim-v1.0-all-fields.json)
- [ ] For any fields _added_ to the claim form, naming convention was copied from the ["all-fields" schema](https://github.com/newjersey/dol-ui-claimant-intake/blob/main/schemas/claim-v1.0-all-fields.json)
- [ ] For any edits to the json schema(s), corresponding updates were made to the [Schema fields spreadsheet](https://sonj.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/DOLPublicUIClaimantPortal/Shared%20Documents/General/Schema%20Info/WIP%20Intake%20App%20Schema%20fields.xlsx?d=wd40d93c3565d4eb6aa7eb1a88f3d8bb0&csf=1&web=1&e=ZNi7Px)
- [ ] Followed guidelines for [zero-downtime deploys](https://spring.io/blog/2016/05/31/zero-downtime-deployment-with-a-database) for any database schema changes

#### Validated user-facing changes ([detailed instructions)](https://github.com/newjersey/dol-ui-claimant-intake/tree/main/docs/a11y-testing-instructions.md):

- [ ] Checked responsiveness in mobile, tablet, and desktop
- [ ] Checked keyboard navigability
- [ ] Tested with [VoiceOver](https://dequeuniversity.com/screenreaders/voiceover-keyboard-shortcuts) in Safari
- [ ] Checked VO's [rotor menu](https://github.com/trussworks/accessibility/wiki/How-to-use-the-rotor-menu-in-VoiceOver) for landmarks, page heading structure and links
- [ ] Used a browser a11y tool to check for issues (WAVE, axe, or Accessibility addon tab for Storybook)
- [ ] Requested a design review for user-facing changes

### As code reviewer(s), I have

#### Reviewed, tested, and left feedback about the changes

- [ ] Pulled this branch locally and tested it
- [ ] Reviewed this code and left comments
- [ ] Checked that all code is adequately covered by tests
- [ ] Verified that application changes affecting the json schema have corresponding schema changes
- [ ] Made it clear which comments need to be addressed before this work is merged
- [ ] Considered marking this as accepted even if there are small changes needed

#### Validated user-facing changes ([detailed instructions)](https://github.com/newjersey/dol-ui-claimant-intake/tree/main/docs/a11y-testing-instructions.md):

### As a designer reviewer, I have

#### Verified that the changes match the design intention

- [ ] Checked in the design translated visually
- [ ] Checked behavior
- [ ] Checked different states (empty, one, some, error)
- [ ] Checked for landmarks, page heading structure, and links
- [ ] Tried to break the intended flow

#### Validated user-facing changes ([detailed instructions)](https://github.com/newjersey/dol-ui-claimant-intake/tree/main/docs/a11y-testing-instructions.md):

- [ ] Checked responsiveness in mobile, tablet, and desktop

* Tested general usability, landmarks, page header structure, and links with a screen reader (one per reviewer, min 2 across reviewers):
  - [ ] [VoiceOver](https://dequeuniversity.com/screenreaders/voiceover-keyboard-shortcuts) in Safari
  - [ ] [JAWS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YGVMAbQgBVYaPhTgzJeMer1iMpBsOSVCshyyu-vmGi4/edit#heading=h.4ufpsgyrhe3p) in Chrome
