## Deployment Preview

<!--
  This feature is still under development, so keeping it un-checked by default for now. Add an x like [x] to select.
  We build a temporary environment with a preview of your pull reques by default if the following criteria are met:
  1. A pull request is edited, opened, synchronize, or reopened
  2. There are changes to the client or server folders
  3. The database or claim json schemas are not changed, as we cannot support that right now, but will in the future
  4. The person creating the pull request has write permission on this repo
  5. *The check box below is checked* (no spaces between the x and the brackets as the workflow looks for that text exactly)
 -->

Check the box below like this: `[x]` if you want a temporary deployment preview environment. If a deployment preview is created, you can visit your deployment preview at https://<branch-name>.claimant-intake-dev1.dol.nj.gov/

## Code Review Verification Steps

[How we work](https://github.com/newjersey/dol-ui-claimant-intake/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### As the original developer, I have

#### Satisfied acceptance criteria and met development standards

- [ ] Met the acceptance criteria, or will meet them in a subsequent PR
- [ ] Created/modified automated tests
- [ ] For any fields that have been edited in or removed from the claim form, corresponding edits have been made in the [json schema](https://github.com/newjersey/dol-ui-claimant-intake/blob/main/schemas/claim-v1.0.json) _and_ synced to the ["all-fields" schema](https://github.com/newjersey/dol-ui-claimant-intake/blob/main/schemas/claim-v1.0-all-fields.json)
- [ ] For any fields _added_ to the claim form, naming convention was copied from the ["all-fields" schema](https://github.com/newjersey/dol-ui-claimant-intake/blob/main/schemas/claim-v1.0-all-fields.json)
- [ ] For any fields added, moved, or removed from the claim form, I have verified that the corresponding representation on the review page has been updated
- [ ] Followed guidelines for [zero-downtime deploys](https://spring.io/blog/2016/05/31/zero-downtime-deployment-with-a-database) for any database schema changes

#### Validated user-facing changes ([detailed instructions)](https://github.com/newjersey/dol-ui-claimant-intake/tree/main/docs/a11y-testing-instructions.md):

- [ ] Requested a design review for user-facing changes
- [ ] Checked responsiveness in mobile, tablet, and desktop
- [ ] Checked keyboard navigability

* Tested general usability, landmarks, page header structure, and links with a screen reader (one per reviewer, min 2 across reviewers):

* Used a browser a11y tool to check for issues
  - [ ] [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/)
  - [ ] [axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/)
  - [ ] [ANDI](https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/andi/help/install.html#install)
