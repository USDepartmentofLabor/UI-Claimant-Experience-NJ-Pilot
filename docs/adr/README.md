# Architectural Decision Records

See [the GitHub ADR organization](https://adr.github.io/) for background and details.

## Adding a new ADR

- Copy the `template.md` file to a new, numbered ADR file. The naming convention is `nnnn-brief-title.md`.
- Add the new file to a new Git branch and create a Pull Request.
- Opening a Pull Request for an ADR does not necessarily mean that the outcome has to be final. It should be a
  complete ADR with a decision drafted, but the Pull Request itself facilitates discussion and is an opportunity to get
  broader feedback on the decision from others.
