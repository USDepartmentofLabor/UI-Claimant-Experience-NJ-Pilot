# Serve client and server separately <!-- The title should reflect the decision outcome -->

- Status: Approved
- Deciders: @kimallen, @brandonlenz, @jsclarridge
- Date: 05/31/22

In the base year, we served the client within the Django app, and served them both in the same Docker container
(see [Serving Static Assets ADR](https://github.com/USDOLEnterprise/ARPAUI/blob/main/docs/adr/0004-serving-static-assets.md)). We used Create React App (CRA).
In the option year, we are using NextJS instead of CRA, we are working within different deployment constraints, and have the option to serve them separately.

## Assumptions

We will be using Docker regardless. There is not significant additional cost to run a second container.

## Considered Alternatives

- Serve the client and server separately
- Serve the client and server together

## Pros and Cons of the Alternatives

### Option 1

- `+` We can easily do server-side rendering out-of-the-box through Nextjs if desired
- `+` Separation of concerns is cleaner and less confusing, supporting current and future developers and interested SWAs
- `+` Separating them is more modular than if not
- `+` We can do caching
- `Â±` More infrastructure to manage, but we have existing patterns for managing the infrastructure
- `-` There are two servers to maintain and vulnerabilities to manage
- `-` We'd need to figure out how to distinguish domain names
- `-` There is some effort to figure out how to manage env variables in the server-side of NextJS (these were previously managed from Django side)

### Option 2

- `+` We can follow similar patterns we used in the base year
- `+` We can do caching
- `-` Less clean, more confusing
- `-` Less modular
- `-` Since we switched to using NextJS instead of CRA, we'd need to figure out how to deal with any differences between usingDjango to serve a static CRA app vs. a NextJS app.

## Decision Outcome

Option 1: Serve the client and server separately
The overall benefits of cleaner, clearer organization outweigh the minimal overhead in setting up and maintaining a second container.
